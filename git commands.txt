***steps to follow for add a change to local repo
git status						//check the status of a branch
git add .						//add all files to the changes
git commit -m "YOUR MESSAGE"				//complete the changing process by giving a comment


***branch commands
git branch 						//check existing branches
git branch NEW_BRANCH					//add a new branch
git checkout ANY_BRANCH					//change branch
git branch -d ANY_BRANCH				//delete a local branch
git push origin --delete ANY_BRANCH			//delete a remote branch


***steps to follow when you want to grab the work in different branch and share it to main branch
git checkout main					//go to main branch
git merge ANY_BRANCH					//copy a branch to main branch

git pull						//grab updated remote repo
git push						//push to remote repo from main branch
git push origin ANY_BRANCH				//push to remote repo from different branch


git rm -r --cached FILE_NAME				//remove a file from git cache
